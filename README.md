# Data Analysis Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio repository! This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects that I have worked on to explore, visualize, 
and gain insights from various datasets. Each project demonstrates my data manipulation, visualization, and interpretation skills to extract meaningful information.



## Projects Overview

Each project is designed to showcase a different aspect of data analysis:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data types, and formatting issues.
- Data Exploration: Investigating key features, trends, and distributions in the data.
- Data Visualization: Creating meaningful visualizations to illustrate insights.
- Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical tests and methods to validate hypotheses.
- Interpretation: Drawing conclusions and providing insights based on the analysis.
