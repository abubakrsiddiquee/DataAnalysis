To use this SQL Covid data Analysis file, you will need to have a compatible SQL server installed and running.
Some popular options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Microsoft SQL Server. As the size of the datasets is big enough 
to upload on GitHub so I provided the link to the datasets by clicking on the link you can download the datasets.
